# Nvim
With this repo, I can download my configs in other machines easely.
---
I mostly use nvim to program in C, C++ and Python. Also to acces any file in my linux.

Basically I have installed NvChad and I use Lazy and Mason to install stuff. I have installed the surround plugins to surround some text, I modified some mapping keys from vim and I installed LSP clangd and pyrigth. And I created a C++ template, so always when I execute nvim *.cpp it loads the template (I most use this for programing competition).

**This repo is supposed to used as config by NvChad users!**

- The main nvchad repo (NvChad/NvChad) is used as a plugin by this repo.
- So you just import its modules , like `require "nvchad.options" , require "nvchad.mappings"`
- So you can delete the .git from this repo ( when you clone it locally ) or fork it :)
